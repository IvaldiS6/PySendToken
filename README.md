# PySendToken

This was written in Windows for Python 3 (It should run anywere that will run Python 3)

You have the option to specify the number of tokens you would like to send to either 1 address or many addresses stored in a CSV file.

The program will only read the first column of the CSV file, so that MUST contain the public address of the accounts you want to airdrop to.

///My testing notes:
I have tested on windows 11 in Visual Studio Code, and it ran successfully
I typed in the full file path eg:  C:/projects/test.csv
It has been successfully tested on an Ubuntu 21.10 VM running in google cloud.
It has been successfully tested on Mac

I made some modifications and have it airdropping to addresses daily on the Ubuntu 21.10 Google Cloud VM

Please let me know about any improvements that can be made

Cheers!
